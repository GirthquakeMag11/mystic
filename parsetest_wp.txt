== History ==

The history of the internet can be traced back to research commissioned by the United States federal government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer networks.[1] The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s. The funding of a new backbone by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks.[2][3] The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet.
